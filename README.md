# Business Understanding
* A telephone company, also known as a telco, telephone service provider, or telecommunications operator, is a kind of communications service provider, more precisely a telecommunications service provider, that provides telecommunications services such as telephony and data communications access.
* Churn rate is the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company over a given period of time.

This case requires data-driven answers to the following questions:
* How many customers are churning?
* What's the insight on churn and non-churn customers based on customers demographic info such as gender, senior citizen, partner, and dependents?
* What's the insight on churn and non-churn customers based on customer services booked  such as phone service multiple lines, internet service, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, streaming TV and streaming movies?
* What's the insight on churn and non-churn customers based on customer account information such as paperless billing, payment method, and contract?
* Is there a relationship between monthly charges, total charges, and tenure on churn rate?



# Data Understanding
#### Data Source
* The data set is a collection of customer retention programs.

# Data Cleansing
* There are 12 columns with each missing 14.3% of its data. We need to fill it so we don't have to lose a lot of data. Missing data that are categorical is filled with "unknown".
* The TotalCharges column has a numeric data type so it is adjusted to float.
* The SeniorCitizen column has a float data type so it is adjusted to be categorical (integer) and and the missing data from the table is filled with the median value.

- About 69% of customers who are charged high monthly fees are still using the service, while about 31% of customers who are charged high monthly fees have stopped using the service.

- The average monthly fee for customers who are charged high monthly fees is \$74.4, while the average monthly fee for customers who are charged low monthly fees is \$61.2.

#### Total Charges

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83635356/200106005-87171e12-2ff3-4531-b4db-80f2c7fbb06a.png)

- The average total fee for customers who are charged higher total fees is \\$2552.9, while the average total fee for customers who are charged lower total fees is \\$1531.8.

#### Tenure

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83635356/200106049-cac20c81-d7c7-457c-aa6d-ce821c4f506e.png)

- **Customers who have been with the company for a shorter period of time are more likely to stop using the service than customers who have been with the company for a longer period of time**.
- About 85% of customers who have been with the company for a shorter period of time are still using the service, while about 15% of customers who have been with the company for a shorter period of time have stopped using the service.
- The average tenure for customers who have been with the company for a shorter period of time is 17 months, while the average tenure for customers who have been with the company for a longer period of time is 37 months.

We can conclude that a higher monthly charge at lower tenure results in a lower total charge. Hence, higher monthly charges, lower tenure, and lower total charges are linked to why customers stopped using the service.

# Feature Engineering
* #### One Hot Encoding and Map
Use the One-Hot Encoding feature for categorical data and the map feature which for ordinal data.

* #### Scaler using standard scaler
Scale tenure and MonthlyCharges feature with StandardScaler.

# Preprocessing Modeling
Before entering the modeling stage, we enter the preprocessing stage first.<br>
At this stage, we do several things, such as:
* #### Feature Selection
We drop customerID because it is an Identifier and TotalCharges because it is a Multicollinear.

* #### Feature Importance
Use Feature Importance bar chart using ExtraTreesClassifier algorithm.

* #### Split Train-Test The Data
Split train-test the data using the train_test_split function.

# Modeling 
### Machine Learning Classification | Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a fundamental classification technique. Logistic regression is fast and relatively uncomplicated, and it’s convenient for you to interpret the results.

# Evaluate Model
After doing the modeling stage such as choosing a model, training the model, and making predictions with the model, we need to evaluate the results of our model predictions so that we can improve our model to be better or more accurate.<br>
In the evaluation modeling stage we do several things, such as:

* #### Confusion Matrix
A confusion matrix, also known as an error matrix, is a specific table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83635356/200107507-02c9f58f-8ad3-460b-86aa-93e58ad27552.png)

* #### Overfit and Underfit
Check whether the model is Overfit or Underfit by comparing the accuracy scores of the train and the test model, if the difference is more than 5% then the model is Overfit or Underfit.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83635356/200107626-dd5ed6b6-c614-43cb-8c6a-2e2be5fef9d1.png)
The model does not have Overfit and Underfit.

* #### AUC/ROC
AUC/ROC is a graph that can show if the model is Overfit or Underfit.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83635356/200107652-78fba9da-bcf8-498b-9988-f4d8e2f79fd4.png)
The model does not have Overfit and Underfit.

* #### Building Model with Cross Validation
Cross-validation is a technique for evaluating ML models by training several ML models on subsets of the available input data and evaluating them on the complementary subset of the data.

* #### Hyperparameter Tuning 
Hyperparameter tuning consists of finding a set of optimal hyperparameter values for a learning algorithm while applying this optimized algorithm to any data set. That combination of hyperparameters maximizes the model's performance, minimizing a predefined loss function to produce better results with fewer errors.

## Remodeling
In the re-modeling stage we use best parameters from to Hyperparameter Tuning improve the model.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83635356/200107940-170f174f-87ef-4a38-bd21-9891cd4d5915.png)

The accuracy rate of predicting customer churn accuracy using machine learning Logistics Regression and after evaluating the model using Hyperparameter Tuning is improved from 0.8232789212207239 to 0.8239886444286728.

# Result

- Customers who use electronic check payment are more likely to churn than customers who use other payment methods.
  
- The accuracy rate of predicting customer churn using machine learning is 82%.

# Recommendation

- Offer lower monthly charges to customers with shorter tenures. This may help to offset the higher costs associated with acquiring new customers.
  
- Offer discounts to customers who bundle services. This may help to encourage customers to stay with the company and use more of its services.
  
- Target marketing campaigns to customers who are at risk of churning. This may help to identify and address the specific needs of these customers.
  
- Improve customer service. This may help to resolve customer issues and complaints more quickly and effectively.
  
- Make it easy for customers to switch payment methods. This may help to reduce the number of customers who churn due to frustration with the payment process.
  
- Develop a customer loyalty program. This can help to reward customers for their continued patronage and encourage them to stay with the company.
